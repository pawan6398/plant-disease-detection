# Plant-Disease-Detection
A project for detecting plant diseases using AI for sustainable agriculture.

## Plant Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

 ### 🔍 A deep learning-based project to detect plant diseases and promote sustainable agriculture.

## 🌱 Project Overview
Plant diseases significantly impact global food production, leading to economic losses for farmers. This project leverages AI and deep learning to identify plant diseases from images, helping farmers take early action and ensure sustainable agriculture.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.10
TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Streamlit (for web-based visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for model training)
Command Prompt & IDLE (for execution)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository
  git clone https://github.com/pawan6398/plant-disease-detection/upload/main  cd Plant-Disease-Detection

## Install Dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Application

  streamlit run main.py 

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased plants.

Classes include powdery mildew, rust, bacterial spot, and healthy leaves.

Images are preprocessed using OpenCV before being fed into the deep learning model.

## 🔬 Model Architecture

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification.

Pretrained models like VGG16 or MobileNet can improve accuracy.

Adam Optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy loss function used.

## 🎯 Key Features  

✅ AI-powered real-time plant disease detection

✅ Supports multiple plant species and disease types

✅ Web-based UI for easy accessibility

✅ Helps farmers take preventive measures for crop health

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

🔹 Improve dataset with more plant species

🔹 Integrate mobile app support for farmers

🔹 Add voice-based disease detection for easy accessibility
